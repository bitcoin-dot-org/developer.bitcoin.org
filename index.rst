The site aims to provide the information you need to understand
Bitcoin and start building Bitcoin-based applications. To make the best use of
this documentation, `make sure you're running a node`_.

For technical support, we recommend `Bitcoin Stack Exchange`_. For errors or
suggestions related to this documentation, please open an issue on `GitHub`_.

Acknowledgments
---------------

This documentation would not be possible without the many contributions to the
Bitcoin project over the years from core developers and other people. A very
special thanks, however, goes to `David Harding`_ who in 2014 helped lead the
effort to compose and bring together a significant amount of the material found
here. Also, to `Cornelius Schumacher`_ for envisioning new ways to extend the
developer documentation that led to this site.
