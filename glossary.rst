  Block
    One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain.

  Block header
  Header
    An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work.

  Public extended key
  Private extended key
    In the context of HD wallets, a public key or private key extended with the chain code to allow them to derive child keys.

  MASF
    A Soft Fork activated by through miner signalling.
